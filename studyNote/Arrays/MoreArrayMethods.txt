More Array Methods
There are many more array methods than just .push() and .pop().
 
You can read about all of the array methods that exist on 
the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) array documentation.

.pop() and .push() mutate the array on which they’re called. 

However, there are times that we don’t want to mutate the original array 
and we can use non-mutating array methods. 

Be sure to check MDN to understand the behavior of the method you are using.

Some arrays methods that are available to JavaScript developers 
include: 
.join(),
 
.slice(),  
Syntax : arr.slice([begin ตัวเลขแรกหมายถึง ตัดออกลำดับที่เท่าไหร่  [,ตัวเลขที่สอง หมายถึง ให้เอาถึงลำดับที่เท่าไหร่]])
console.log(array.method(first, last+1));

.splice(), 
.shift(), 
.unshift(), 
and .concat() amongst many others. 

Using these built-in methods make it easier to do some common tasks when working with arrays.

Below, we will explore some methods that we have not learned yet. 
We will use these methods to edit a grocery list. 
As you complete the steps, you can consult the MDN documentation to learn what each method does!
