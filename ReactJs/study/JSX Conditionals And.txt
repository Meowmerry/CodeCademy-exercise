JSX Conditionals: &&
We’re going to cover one final way of writing conditionals 
in React: the && operator.

Like the ternary operator, && is not React-specific, 
but it shows up in React surprisingly often.

In the last two lessons, you wrote statements 
that would sometimes render a kitty and other times render a doggy. 
&& would not have been the best choice for those lessons.

&& works best in conditionals that will sometimes do an action, 
but other times do nothing at all.

Here’s an example:

const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    { !baby && <li>Pizza</li> }
    { age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li> }
    { age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li> }
    { age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li> }
  </ul>
);
Every time that you see && in this example, either some code will run, 
or else no code will run.
